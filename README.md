# BigQuery SQL Queries

This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing muxed account data in
BigQuery. This repository contains a collection of BigQuery queries that I,
[Leigh] have personally found helpful when using [Stellar Hubble]. Stellar
Hubble is the public BigQuery repository containing historical/archive data for
the [Stellar Network].

These queries are not intended for general consumption and collect data
specific to the use cases I have encountered. Use at your own risk.
